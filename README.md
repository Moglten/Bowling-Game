TDD Game Project to handle the rolling and scoring in bowling game.


### Brief On TDD
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit tests before developing the production code.
It is an iterative approach that combines code implementation, the creation of unit tests, and refactoring.

The 3-Sided Hat approch used by Uncle Bob 

    1) Write only enough of a unit test to fail.
    2) Write only enough production code to make the failing unit test pass.
    3) Refactoring with confidence.
